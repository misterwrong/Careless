# Careless

Automatically downloads articles from a specific Tiny Tiny RSS feed.

Tiny Tiny RSS is an RSS feed reader that you can install locally to assemble all your articles in a convenient place, much like Feedly and the former Google Reader. Many sites however publish only summaries or introductions over RSS, instead of the whole article. Careless is a small Groovy script that makes use of Tiny Tiny Rss's exposed API to find the links inside and if they are magnet links download the article using Transmission.

Populate the variables at the start of the script to point it towards your local Tiny Tiny RSS installation and the right feed.
